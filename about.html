          <span> Over-Under-Thinking" is about my way of thinking. It's about my brain, my views on my life, and my (debatably terrible) opinions. I tend to overthink topics that shouldn't require much thinking (underthinking).... ALSO: now that I have had some time to think about it I really should've taken some time to bounce this idea off of someones head. 4 months later and I think this might be the dumbest name of all time (okay its not that bad but its also pretty bad). Once the domain expires I'll change the name of the site and the styling to go with it cause wowza.</span>

          <span>I am a 24 year old computer science student at California State University, Northridge. This was my first attempt at web development which I have taken a liking to as I plan to branch into that field after graduation. My blogs are solely written out of enjoyment, but I have found somewhat of a fun outlet through creative writing that I could possibly see myself wanting to delve more into in the future.</span>
